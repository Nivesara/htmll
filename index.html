   <p>Anything that is joyful to behold that captures our heart is beautiful. It could be in a flower, a baby, even in the serenity of an old woman, the love of a parent or the playfulness of a puppy. Like it has been rightly said; beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder. Not everyone sees beauty in the same thing.Beauty of the mind is something that does not depend on the external circumstances. The beauty is seen and felt in the thoughts and actions of the person. A confident person with a kind heart exudes beauty of its own kind irrespective of the physical attributes. A person with a beautiful mind is liked by all long after the physical beauty is gone. A mind may be refined by acquiring knowledge, experience, and wisdom and by cultivating a kind spirit.
